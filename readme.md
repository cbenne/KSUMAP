###The Flask server was set up in a virtual environment that can be activated by running 'source bin/activate' in the directory on the server. The site can then be run on port 8182 over HTTP by running 'FLASK_APP=app.py flask run --port 8182 --host=0.0.0.0'. This will create a SQLite database on the CSV's included in the file (for maximum portability) - managed by database.py. The app.py file handles URL requests, and can be easily updated in the future to add more request handling.

###The Cantaloupe Image Server is a relatively painless setup. In order for it to work, the directory just needs to be copied to the server of choice. The cantaloupe.properties file will need to be updated to change where it looks for images to serve, but will otherwise be fully preconfigured. Starting the server only requires 'java -Dcantaloupe.config=/path/to/cantaloupe-4.0.2/cantaloupe.properties -Xmx2g -jar cantaloupe-4.0.2.war'

###All mapping features are implemented by map.js, and search features/JSON requests handled by the functions in search.js. I unfortunately completed this part before learning about transpiling from ECMA6 to ECMA5, so the files are merely loaded in the correct order to integrate with eachother. Search.js also holds autocomplete features which dynamically create suggestions based on user input.
